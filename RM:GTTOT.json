You gain an accute sense of smell which lets you easily identify and follow odours and recognise people in disguise. You can track by scent and the base DC of any track test you make is 5 regardless of the terrain, increased by +2 for each day old the track is. You can detect poisoned food, drink and objects, and even strong emotions like anger and fear. Additionally, you can speak with snakes and reptiles of animal intelligence, and they react friendly towards you. This doesn't include magical beasts. At 6th level, you are able to smell magical auras, like a detect magic spell."
