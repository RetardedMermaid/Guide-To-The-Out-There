				"You gain advantage on any saving throw against poison damage or {@condition poisoned}. You also enhance your sense of smell to snake-like levels. This allows you to easily recognize people and objects by their unique scent, thus you can track by scent. The base DC of any track test you make is 5 regardless of the terrain, increased by +2 for each day old the track is. You can detect poisoned food, drinks, objects, etc. and even strong emotions like anger or fear. Additionally, this invocation also grants you the ability speak with snakes and reptiles of animal intelligence, and they react friendly towards you (does not include magical beasts)".

You also become immune to natural cold, and you have advantage on all saving throws against cold damage."
