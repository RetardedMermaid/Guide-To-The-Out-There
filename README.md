Warlock Invocations

[Note: this is designed to give Warlocks a little boon, as they are considered the weakest class of 5e by many.]

This is my homebrew attempt of balancing warlocks for my campaign, because they are a rather unpopular class, not only because of their low
power and utility, but also because of how they feel like cleric-wannabes, with no real identity other than their measily abilities. I'll
keep adding material to this list as it get tested by me in my 2 campaigns.
